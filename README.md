# Hi there! 👋 I'm Fedor

I'm a Python developer with a strong passion for **data analytics**, **computer vision**, and **building neural networks**. I also have some experience working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## My Interests:
- 📊 **Data Analytics**: extracting and analyzing data to drive insights and decision-making.
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: working with images and videos, developing models for visual tasks.
- 🧠 **Neural Networks**: researching and building models to solve complex problems.
- 🤖 **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: exploring and applying large language models for text-based applications.

## My Tech Stack:
- **Programming languages**: Python, with some experience in other languages.
- **Tools and libraries**:
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn — for data manipulation and visualization.
  - OpenCV, Pillow — for image processing.
  - TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch — for building and training neural networks.
  - Hugging Face Transformers — for working with LLMs.

## My Projects:
Here you'll find the projects I'm working on related to machine learning, data analytics, and computer vision. Feel free to check them out!
